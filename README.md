# Ant Colony â€“ NEAT-Powered Simulation

Simulation of ants evolve through a NEAT algorithm. 
Ants learn to grab food and bring it back to their nests.
Fast ants are quicker to food but deplete hunger faster

# What to look for
Colored ants green (slow) - red (fast)
White ants have food with them
Black dots around screen are the nests
Food is the red dots

# Key Settings
```python
MAX_FOOD = 10  #how many food items can be on the screen at once
FOOD_SPAWN_TIME = 30 # frames between food drops
MAX_FRAMES = 1000 # how many frames the simulation runs for so this is one minute
ANT_COUNT = 100 # how many ants are in the simulation
```
